            <h2>Effective Interest Rate Calculation Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>The effective interest rate shown is calculated based on the total interest paid over the actual duration of the loan, taking into account any extra payments made. It represents the annualized interest rate you effectively pay, differing from the nominal rate due to these additional payments.</p>
